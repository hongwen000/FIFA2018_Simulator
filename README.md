# FIFA2018_Simulator

This project is the second assignment of the Senior Programming Projects I course.

This is a teamwork with my partner Zhu Yikang (朱祎康), he contributed the core mathematical model.

This project works on how to simulate and report FIFA 2018. We use web crawler to get data, sorting by rank to deal with it and build the mathematical model of the match.
